# DSA II Projects
###### Projects for Data Structures & Algorithms II (ECE 365)

This course consisted of four projects.

The first three project built upon each other:
- Project 1 consisted of building a hash table from scratch.
- Project 2 consisted of building a binary heap from scratch.
- Project 3 used the previously developed hash table and binary heap to implement Dijkstra's algorithm.

Project 4 was to solve a dynamic programming problem from the 1998 regional ACM Programming Contest.
