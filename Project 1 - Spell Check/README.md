## Project 1 - Spell Check

Project 1 was to create a hash table from scratch and use the built hash table to spell-check a document.
The progran will be given a text file as input, which it will read and store valid words from. Then, the program will be given a text file to spell-check and will print any invalid words and where they occur.
